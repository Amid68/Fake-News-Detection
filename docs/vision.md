**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Author:** Ameed Othman
**Date:** 04.03.2025

## 1. Introduction & Project Goal

### Project Description
This project aims to develop a web application that aggregates news articles from reliable English language sources, generates concise summaries using large language models (LLMs), analyzes potential political bias, and provides a personalized news feed based on user preferences.

### Problem Statement
In an era of information overload and pervasive misinformation, individuals struggle to efficiently process news from diverse sources and identify biases. Many users lack the time to read full articles from multiple perspectives, leading to information silos and uncritical news consumption.

### Solution Approach
This tool addresses these challenges by:
- Centralizing news from diverse, reliable sources
- Providing concise, accurate summaries of key information
- Offering transparent bias analysis to promote critical thinking
- Personalizing content while avoiding filter bubbles

### Ultimate Goal
The project will deliver a functional web application that demonstrates proficiency in data engineering, machine learning integration, and software development. While the long-term vision includes multilingual capabilities, the graduation project will focus on delivering a robust English-language foundation.

## 2. Target Users

The tool targets:

- **Busy professionals** who need efficient news consumption
- **Critical thinkers** concerned about media bias
- **Students and researchers** studying media and information systems
- **Technology enthusiasts** interested in AI/ML applications for news

## 3. Key Features (MVP Scope)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will deliver:

### Essential Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login system
