## 1. Introduction & Project Goal

### Project Description
This project will develop a web application that detects fake news and misinformation using lightweight pre-trained language models, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. The system will analyze news content, evaluate its credibility, and provide users with an assessment of potential misinformation.

### Problem Statement
In the age of large language models (LLMs), the creation and spread of convincing misinformation has become increasingly accessible. Anyone with a digital device can generate fake content that appears legitimate. Traditional deep learning-based fake news detection (FND) models require significant computational resources, making them impractical for widespread deployment, especially in resource-limited settings.

### Solution Approach
This tool addresses these challenges by:
- Implementing and comparing lightweight pre-trained language models for FND
- Optimizing models for resource-constrained environments
- Providing an accessible interface for users to verify news content
- Balancing the tradeoff between model accuracy and computational efficiency

### Ultimate Goal
The project will deliver a functional web application that demonstrates the effectiveness of lightweight models for fake news detection. It will enable users to quickly assess the credibility of news articles while requiring minimal computational resources. The project will contribute to the understanding of efficient misinformation detection techniques.

## 2. Target Users
