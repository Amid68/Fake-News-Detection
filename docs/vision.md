## Project Title
Automated Multilingual News Aggregation, Summarization, and Bias Detection Tool

## 1. Introduction & Project Goal
- **Project Description:** This project aims to develop a web application that automatically aggregates news articles from reliable English language sources, generates concise summaries using large language models (LLMs), detects potential political bias with LLMs, and provides a personalized news feed based on user preferences.
  
- **Problem Solved:** In an era of information overload and pervasive misinformation, individuals struggle to efficiently process news from diverse sources and identify biases. This tool tackles these challenges by delivering summarized news and highlighting potential biases, enabling users to consume information more critically and effectively.

- **Ultimate Goal:** The long-term vision is to create a comprehensive, multilingual news analysis platform that empowers users to become informed and critical news consumers. Simultaneously, this project will serve as a portfolio piece, demonstrating proficiency in data engineering, machine learning, and software engineering to prepare for job opportunities in AI and data-intensive software fields.

## 2. Target Users
The tool targets:
- Individuals keen on staying updated with global news.
- Researchers investigating media bias.
- Data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts exploring natural language processing (NLP) and bias detection.
- Users seeking an efficient way to consume news from reliable sources, with plans to support multiple languages in the future.

## 3. Key Features (Stage 1: Web Application)
The initial stage focuses on a functional web application with the following core features:
- **User Authentication:** Enable users to register and log in, allowing them to save their preferences securely.
- **News Aggregation:** Fetch articles from at least three reliable English language sources based on user-selected topics or keywords.
- **Automated Summarization:** Leverage an open-source LLM to produce concise, accurate summaries of aggregated news articles.
- **Bias Detection:** Utilize LLMs to identify and highlight potential political bias in news articles.
- **Personalized News Feed:** Display a tailored news feed based on the userâ€™s saved topics of interest.
- **User Interface:** Develop an intuitive web interface for users to manage preferences, browse their news feed, and view summaries and bias analysis for individual articles.

## 4. Success Metrics (Stage 1)
The success of Stage 1 will be measured by:
- Aggregating news articles from at least three distinct English sources effectively.
- Generating accurate article summaries using an LLM, evaluated qualitatively.
- Implementing functional bias detection, assessed against a benchmark dataset (if available) or through qualitative review.
- Deploying a fully operational web application accessible online.
- Ensuring user authentication works seamlessly, allowing registration, login, and preference saving.
- Confirming the personalized news feed displays relevant articles aligned with user-selected topics.

## 5. Future Vision
Beyond Stage 1, the project will evolve to:
- Expand language support to include German and Arabic sources.
- Enhance bias detection to cover cultural and other bias types.
- Develop advanced recommendation systems driven by user interactions and behavior.
- Create a browser extension and mobile app for broader accessibility.
- Ultimately, establish a robust, multilingual platform for news analysis and consumption.

## 6. Technologies (Initial Thoughts)
The following technologies are under consideration for Stage 1, with flexibility for refinement:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Django
- **Open-Source LLM:** To be determined
- **NLP Libraries:** NLTK, spaCy, Transformers
- **Data Storage:** SQLite or a similar lightweight database initially
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially with React or Vue.js)
