# Testing Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive testing documentation for the News Aggregator application.

## Test Organization

The tests are organized as follows:

- **Manual Tests**: Step-by-step scenarios to validate functionality
  - `user_tests.md`: User authentication and profile management tests
  - `news_tests.md`: News article viewing and interaction tests
  - `processing_tests.md`: Article processing (summarization and bias detection) tests
  - `integration_tests.md`: End-to-end tests that cross multiple components

## How to Use These Tests

1. **Preparation**: Ensure your development environment is properly set up
2. **Execution**: Follow each test step in sequence
3. **Recording**: Document the results, including:
   - Pass/Fail status
   - Any defects found
   - Screenshots of issues
   - Notes on unexpected behavior

## Test Execution Process

For each test:

1. Start with a clean environment when possible
2. Follow the preconditions exactly
3. Execute steps in the specified order
4. Compare actual results with expected results
5. Mark the test as PASS or FAIL
6. Document any defects with detailed reproduction steps

## Test Reporting Template

```

```

## Defect Tracking

For each defect found, create an issue in the project's issue tracking system with:

1. A clear, descriptive title
2. The test case ID that discovered the defect
3. Detailed reproduction steps
4. Expected vs. actual results
5. Environment information
6. Severity assessment
7. Screenshots or videos when applicable

## Test Coverage Tracking

This test suite aims to cover:

- Core user authentication and profile management
- News article viewing and interaction
- AI-powered processing features
- Integration between system components
- Performance under various conditions
- Security and error handling

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Use the established template structure
2. Assign a unique test ID in the format TC-[Module]-[Number]
3. Ensure steps are clear and specific
4. Define measurable expected results
5. Document any special preconditions or setup requirements
6. Update this README if new test categories are added
