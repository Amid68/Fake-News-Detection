**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the admin interface
2. Access the "Articles" section
3. Select an article without summary
4. Trigger summarization processing (if available)
5. Monitor the task status
6. Select an article without bias analysis
7. Trigger bias detection processing (if available)
8. Monitor the task status

**Expected Results**:
- Manual processing triggers are available
- Processing tasks are created when triggered
- Tasks appear in the processing queue
- Tasks eventually complete
- Processed articles show results when completed

**Pass/Fail Criteria**: Administrators can manually trigger and monitor article processing

**Notes**: This test is for admin users only and may take time to complete depending on processing speed

## Test Case ID: TC-PROC-005

**Title**: View Processing Results Timeline

**Description**: Verify that the system maintains a timeline of processing for articles

**Preconditions**:
- The application is running
- Admin user is logged in
- Articles with processing history exist

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the admin interface
2. Access the "Articles" section
3. Select an article with processing history
4. View the timeline or history of processing
5. Check timestamps for various processing events
6. Check for any reprocessing events

**Expected Results**:
- Processing history is maintained for articles
- Timeline shows when summarization was performed
- Timeline shows when bias detection was performed
- Timestamps are accurate
- Any reprocessing events are clearly indicated

**Pass/Fail Criteria**: System maintains an accurate record of article processing history

**Notes**: This test is for admin users only and assumes a processing history feature is implemented

## Test Case ID: TC-PROC-006

**Title**: Bulk Processing Command

**Description**: Verify that the management command for bulk article processing works correctly

**Preconditions**:
- The application is running
- Unprocessed articles exist in the system
- User has command-line access

**Test Steps**:
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Run the command: `python manage.py process_articles --type summarization`
5. Monitor the output

7. Run the command: `python manage.py process_articles --type bias_detection`
8. Monitor the output
9. Check the database for newly created tasks

**Expected Results**:
- Commands execute without errors
- Output indicates number of articles queued for processing
- Processing tasks are created in the database
- Tasks are eventually processed
- Articles show processing results when completed
