# Automated Testing Documentation

## Testing Strategy
This project employs automated testing to ensure code quality and functionality across various modules. Each module has its own set of tests located in the respective `tests` directory.

## Testing Framework
The project uses `pytest` as the testing framework. Ensure that `pytest` is installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install pytest
```

## Running the Tests
To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:

```
pytest
```

This command will discover and run all the test files in the `tests` directories across the project.

## Dependencies
Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:
- pytest

## Example Test Cases
