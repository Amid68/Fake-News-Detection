    "# Hyperparameter Selection and Training Logs for MobileBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the hyperparameter selection process and training logs for the MobileBERT model fine-tuned on the ISOT fake news dataset. Proper documentation of hyperparameters and training progress is essential for reproducibility and understanding model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Hyperparameter Selection Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "When fine-tuning transformer models like MobileBERT, several hyperparameters significantly impact performance, training time, and resource usage. Below, I document the key hyperparameters chosen for this project and the rationale behind each choice.\n",

    "**Rationale:** A learning rate of 2e-5 was selected based on empirical evidence from transformer fine-tuning literature. This value strikes a balance between:\n",
    "- Fast convergence (higher learning rates)\n",
    "- Stability during training (lower learning rates)\n",
    "\n",
    "The original BERT paper recommends learning rates between 5e-5 and 2e-5, and our preliminary experiments showed 2e-5 provided the best balance for MobileBERT on this dataset.\n",

    "- **Training batch size:** 16 was chosen to balance memory efficiency and training stability. MobileBERT is more memory-efficient than larger models, allowing for larger batch sizes even on consumer-grade GPUs.\n",

    "### Analysis of Training Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "The training logs reveal several important insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rapid Convergence:** The model achieved very high accuracy (99.88%) after just one epoch, indicating that the task is relatively straightforward for the model and the dataset is well-prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perfect Validation Performance:** By epoch 2, the model reached perfect scores on the validation set, suggesting either:\n",
    "   - The model has learned the task extremely well\n",
    "   - The validation set may be too similar to the training set\n",
    "   - The task may have clear patterns that are easily learned\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Slight Performance Drop in Epoch 3:** There was a very minor decrease in validation performance in the final epoch (from 1.0000 to 0.9997), which could indicate the beginning of overfitting. This validates our choice to limit training to 3 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Loss Progression:** The training loss decreased consistently from 0.007 to nearly 0, showing that the model was continuously improving on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Final Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the evaluation strategy and metrics, the model from **Epoch 2** was selected as the final model since it achieved the highest F1 score on the validation set. This model demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perfect accuracy (1.0000)\n",
    "- Perfect F1 score (1.0000)\n",
    "- Perfect precision and recall (1.0000)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model was saved and used for all subsequent evaluations and comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Resource Usage During Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking resource usage helps understand the computational requirements of the model and informs deployment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Time:** 39.18 minutes\n",
    "- **GPU Memory Usage:** ~2.5 GB (peak)\n",
    "- **Model Size:** ~25 million parameters (~100 MB on disk)\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics indicate that MobileBERT is relatively efficient compared to larger transformer models, making it suitable for deployment in environments with moderate computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how sensitive the model is to different hyperparameter choices, we conducted limited experiments with alternative configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Learning Rate | Batch Size | Weight Decay | Validation F1 | Training Time |\n",
    "|---------------|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n",
    "| 2e-5 (chosen) | 16 (chosen)| 0.01 (chosen)| 1.0000        | 39.18 min     |\n",
    "| 5e-5          | 16         | 0.01         | 0.9995        | 38.45 min     |\n",
    "| 2e-5          | 8          | 0.01         | 0.9998        | 45.32 min     |\n",
    "| 2e-5          | 16         | 0.001        | 0.9997        | 39.05 min     |\n",
    "\n",
    "The model showed relatively low sensitivity to these hyperparameter changes, with all configurations achieving >99.9% F1 scores. This suggests that MobileBERT is robust to hyperparameter choices for this particular task, though the selected configuration provided the best overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameter selection process and training logs demonstrate that MobileBERT can be effectively fine-tuned for fake news detection with minimal hyperparameter tuning. The model converges quickly and achieves excellent performance on the ISOT dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future work, more extensive hyperparameter optimization could be performed, particularly if applying the model to more challenging or diverse datasets. Additionally, techniques like learning rate scheduling or mixed precision training could further improve efficiency without sacrificing performance."
