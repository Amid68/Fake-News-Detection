# DistilBERT Evaluation for Fake News Detection

## Introduction

This notebook evaluates our fine-tuned DistilBERT model for fake news detection. DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT that retains 95% of BERT's performance while using 40% fewer parameters. This model was developed by the Hugging Face team using knowledge distillation, making it an excellent candidate for deployment in environments with limited computational resources.

We'll perform a comprehensive evaluation focusing on:

1. Performance on the WELFake test dataset
2. Generalization capabilities when tested on external datasets containing verified real news and AI-generated fake news
3. Resource efficiency metrics critical for edge device deployment:
   - Memory footprint
   - Inference speed
   - Batch processing efficiency
   - Sequence length impact

The goal is to determine if distilled transformer models like DistilBERT can effectively detect fake news while meeting the practical constraints of resource-limited environments.

## Setting Up the Environment

First, we'll import the necessary libraries for our evaluation:


```python
# Import basic libraries for data manipulation and visualization
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import time
import os
import psutil
import gc
```


```python
# Import PyTorch and transformers
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
```


```python
# Import evaluation metrics
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```


```python
# Improved memory measurement function
def measure_peak_memory_usage(func, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Measure peak memory usage during function execution
    
    Args:
        func: Function to measure
        *args, **kwargs: Arguments to pass to the function
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (function result, peak memory usage in MB)
    """
    # Reset garbage collection and force collection before starting
    gc.collect()
    
    # Start tracking
    process = psutil.Process()
    start_memory = process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)
    peak_memory = start_memory
    
    # Define a memory tracking function
    def track_peak_memory():
        nonlocal peak_memory
        current = process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)
        peak_memory = max(peak_memory, current)
    
    # Set up a timer to periodically check memory
    import threading
    stop_tracking = False
    
    def memory_tracker():
        while not stop_tracking:
            track_peak_memory()
            time.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Start tracking thread
    tracking_thread = threading.Thread(target=memory_tracker)
    tracking_thread.daemon = True
    tracking_thread.start()
    
    # Run the function
    try:
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    finally:
        # Stop tracking
        stop_tracking = True
        tracking_thread.join(timeout=1.0)
    
    # Calculate memory used
    memory_used = peak_memory - start_memory
    
    return result, memory_used
```


```python
# Suppress warnings and set visualization style
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Set consistent visualization style
plt.style.use('ggplot')
sns.set(font_scale=1.2)
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 6)

# Force CPU usage to simulate edge device performance
device = torch.device("cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device} (simulating edge device performance)")
```

    Using device: cpu (simulating edge device performance)


## Loading Data

### External Datasets

To evaluate the model's generalization capabilities, we'll also test it on external datasets containing news articles not seen during training. This helps assess how well the model performs on real-world content.


```python
# Load external datasets
real_df = pd.read_csv('../datasets/manual_real.csv')
fake_df = pd.read_csv('../datasets/fake_claude.csv')
```


```python
# Process real news data
if 'title' in real_df.columns and 'content' in real_df.columns:
    real_df['combined_text'] = real_df['title'] + " " + real_df['content']
elif 'text' in real_df.columns:
    real_df['combined_text'] = real_df['text']
real_df['label'] = 0  # Real news

# Process fake news data
if 'title' in fake_df.columns and 'content' in fake_df.columns:
    fake_df['combined_text'] = fake_df['title'] + " " + fake_df['content']
elif 'text' in fake_df.columns:
    fake_df['combined_text'] = fake_df['text']
fake_df['label'] = 1  # Fake news
```


```python
# Combine external datasets
external_df = pd.concat(
    [real_df[['combined_text', 'label']], fake_df[['combined_text', 'label']]],
    ignore_index=True
)
X_external = external_df['combined_text']
y_external = external_df['label']

print(f"External dataset: {len(external_df)} articles ({len(real_df)} real, {len(fake_df)} fake)")
```

    External dataset: 858 articles (429 real, 429 fake)


## Loading and Measuring DistilBERT

Now we'll load our fine-tuned DistilBERT model and measure its resource requirements, which is critical information for edge deployment scenarios.


```python
# Clean up before loading
gc.collect()

# Measure memory before model loading
memory_before = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)  # MB

# Load the DistilBERT model and tokenizer
model_path = '../../ml_models/distilbert_welfake_model'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = model.to(device)
```


```python
# Measure memory after model loading
memory_after = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)  # MB
model_memory = memory_after - memory_before

# Calculate model size from parameters
param_size = sum(p.nelement() * p.element_size() for p in model.parameters()) / (1024 * 1024)
num_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())

print(f"DistilBERT model loaded successfully")
print(f"Number of parameters: {num_params:,}")
print(f"Model size: {param_size:.2f} MB")
print(f"Memory increase after loading: {model_memory:.2f} MB")
```

    DistilBERT model loaded successfully
    Number of parameters: 66,955,010
    Model size: 255.41 MB
    Memory increase after loading: 419.61 MB


## Preparing Data for Evaluation

Before we can evaluate the model, we need to tokenize our text data and prepare it in the format expected by the transformer model.


```python
def prepare_data(texts, labels, tokenizer, batch_size=32):
    """
    Tokenize text data and create DataLoader for model input
    
    Args:
        texts: List or Series of text samples
        labels: List or Series of labels
        tokenizer: The tokenizer to use
        batch_size: Batch size for DataLoader
        
    Returns:
        DataLoader with tokenized inputs and labels
    """
    # Tokenize the text
    encodings = tokenizer(
        list(texts),
        truncation=True,
        padding='max_length',
        max_length=512,  # Standard for BERT models
        return_tensors='pt'
    )
    
    # Create dataset and dataloader
    dataset = TensorDataset(
        encodings['input_ids'],
        encodings['attention_mask'],
        torch.tensor(labels.values if hasattr(labels, 'values') else labels)
    )
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)
    
    return dataloader
```


```python
# Prepare test sets
external_loader = prepare_data(X_external, y_external, tokenizer)
```

## Evaluation Function

We'll define a comprehensive evaluation function that measures both performance metrics and resource usage. This modified version uses our improved memory measurement approach.


```python
def evaluate_model(model, dataloader, dataset_name):
    """
    Evaluate model and measure performance metrics and resource usage
    
    Args:
        model: The model to evaluate
        dataloader: DataLoader with test data
        dataset_name: Name of the dataset for reporting
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with performance metrics and resource usage
    """
    model.eval()
    
    # Define the prediction function to measure
    def make_predictions():
        all_preds = []
        all_labels = []
        
        start_time = time.time()
        with torch.no_grad():
            for batch in dataloader:
                input_ids, attention_mask, labels = [b.to(device) for b in batch]
                outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
                preds = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)
                
                all_preds.extend(preds.cpu().numpy())
                all_labels.extend(labels.cpu().numpy())
        
        predict_time = time.time() - start_time
        return all_preds, all_labels, predict_time
    
    # Run predictions with memory measurement
    (all_preds, all_labels, predict_time), memory_used = measure_peak_memory_usage(make_predictions)
    
    # Convert to numpy arrays
    all_preds = np.array(all_preds)
    all_labels = np.array(all_labels)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    accuracy = accuracy_score(all_labels, all_preds)
    precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(
        all_labels, all_preds, average='weighted'
    )
    
    # Print results
    print(f"\nDistilBERT Evaluation on {dataset_name}:")
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
    print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
    print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
    print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
    print(f"Prediction time: {predict_time:.2f} seconds for {len(all_labels)} samples")
    print(f"Average prediction time: {predict_time/len(all_labels)*1000:.2f} ms per sample")
    print(f"Peak memory usage during inference: {memory_used:.2f} MB")
    
    # Return results for visualization
    return {
        'y_pred': all_preds,
        'y_true': all_labels,
        'accuracy': accuracy,
        'precision': precision,
        'recall': recall,
        'f1': f1,
        'predict_time': predict_time,
        'samples': len(all_labels),
        'memory_used': memory_used
    }
```

### Confusion Matrix for WELFake

Visualizing the confusion matrix helps us understand where the model makes errors and whether there are any patterns in its mistakes.


```python
# Create and plot confusion matrix
def plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, title):
    """
    Create and visualize confusion matrix
    
    Args:
        y_true: True labels
        y_pred: Predicted labels
        title: Plot title
    """
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues',
                xticklabels=['Real News', 'Fake News'],
                yticklabels=['Real News', 'Fake News'])
    plt.title(title)
    plt.ylabel('True Label')
    plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    
    # Calculate error rates
    tn, fp, fn, tp = cm.ravel()
    fpr = fp/(fp+tn)
    fnr = fn/(fn+tp)
    print(f"False Positive Rate: {fpr:.4f} ({fp} real news articles misclassified as fake)")
    print(f"False Negative Rate: {fnr:.4f} ({fn} fake news articles misclassified as real)")
```

## Performance on External Datasets

To assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data, we'll evaluate it on our external datasets.


```python
# Evaluate on external datasets
external_results = evaluate_model(model, external_loader, "External Datasets")
```

    
    DistilBERT Evaluation on External Datasets:
    Accuracy: 0.7075
    Precision: 0.8103
    Recall: 0.7075
    F1 Score: 0.6810
    Prediction time: 44.95 seconds for 858 samples
    Average prediction time: 52.38 ms per sample
    Peak memory usage during inference: 1143.52 MB


### Confusion Matrix for External Data


```python
# Create and plot confusion matrix
def plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, title):
    """
    Create and visualize confusion matrix
    
    Args:
        y_true: True labels

        title: Plot title
    """
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues',
                xticklabels=['Real News', 'Fake News'],
                yticklabels=['Real News', 'Fake News'])
    plt.title(title)
    plt.ylabel('True Label')
    plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    
    # Calculate error rates
    tn, fp, fn, tp = cm.ravel()
    fpr = fp/(fp+tn)
    fnr = fn/(fn+tp)
    print(f"False Positive Rate: {fpr:.4f} ({fp} real news articles misclassified as fake)")
    print(f"False Negative Rate: {fnr:.4f} ({fn} fake news articles misclassified as real)")
```


```python
# Plot confusion matrix for External Datasets
plot_confusion_matrix(
    external_results['y_true'], 
    external_results['y_pred'], 
    "DistilBERT Confusion Matrix on External Datasets"
)
```


    
![png](output_25_0.png)
    


    False Positive Rate: 0.0047 (2 real news articles misclassified as fake)
    False Negative Rate: 0.5804 (249 fake news articles misclassified as real)


### Analysis of External Dataset Performance

The results on external datasets reveal an interesting pattern:

1. **Perfect Precision on Real News**: The model correctly classified all 399 real news articles (0 false positives), showing exceptional precision for real news.

2. **Poor Recall on Fake News**: The model misclassified 295 out of 429 fake news articles as real (68.76% false negative rate), demonstrating a strong bias toward predicting "real" when facing unfamiliar patterns.

This asymmetric performance is particularly problematic for fake news detection, where missing fake news (false negatives) could be more harmful than falsely flagging real news. The model appears to have learned patterns specific to the WELFake dataset's fake news examples but struggles to generalize these patterns to new examples with different characteristics.

Such behavior is common in transformer models when the distribution of the test data differs significantly from the training data. In this case, the AI-generated fake news in the external dataset likely contains more subtle indicators of fabrication than the WELFake training examples.

## Analyzing Misclassified Examples

Understanding specific cases where the model fails can provide insights into its limitations and potential areas for improvement.


```python
def analyze_errors(X_text, y_true, y_pred, dataset_name, n_examples=3):
    """
    Display examples of misclassified articles
    
    Args:
        X_text: Text data
        y_true: True labels
        y_pred: Predicted labels
        dataset_name: Name of the dataset
        n_examples: Number of examples to display
    """
    errors = np.where(y_true != y_pred)[0]
    
    if len(errors) == 0:
        print(f"No errors found on {dataset_name}!")
        return
    
    print(f"\nDistilBERT misclassified {len(errors)} out of {len(y_true)} articles on {dataset_name} ({len(errors)/len(y_true):.2%})")
    print(f"Showing {min(n_examples, len(errors))} examples:")
    
    # Select random errors to display
    np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
    display_indices = np.random.choice(errors, size=min(n_examples, len(errors)), replace=False)
    
    for i, idx in enumerate(display_indices):
        print(f"\nExample {i+1}:")
        print(f"Text snippet: {X_text.iloc[idx][:200]}...")  # First 200 chars
        print(f"True label: {'Real' if y_true[idx] == 0 else 'Fake'}")
        print(f"Predicted: {'Real' if y_pred[idx] == 0 else 'Fake'}")
        print("-" * 80)
```


```python
# Analyze errors on External datasets
analyze_errors(
    X_external, 
    external_results['y_true'], 
    external_results['y_pred'], 
    "External Datasets"

## Edge Device Performance Analysis

For deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, understanding how batch size affects inference efficiency is critical for optimizing throughput versus latency trade-offs.


```python
# Analyze batch processing efficiency
batch_sizes = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
results = []

# Create sample input
sample_text = ["This is a sample news article for testing inference speed."] * 32
sample_encodings = tokenizer(
    sample_text,
    truncation=True,
    padding='max_length',
    max_length=512,
    return_tensors='pt'
)
```


```python
# Test different batch sizes
for batch_size in batch_sizes:
    # Prepare input batch
    input_ids = sample_encodings['input_ids'][:batch_size].to(device)
    attention_mask = sample_encodings['attention_mask'][:batch_size].to(device)
    
    # Warm-up
    with torch.no_grad():
        _ = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
    
    # Timed runs
    times = []
    for _ in range(5):  # 5 runs per batch size
        with torch.no_grad():
            start = time.time()
            _ = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
            end = time.time()
        times.append(end - start)
    
    # Calculate statistics
    avg_time = np.mean(times)
    per_sample = avg_time / batch_size * 1000  # ms
    
    results.append({
        'Batch Size': batch_size,
        'Total Time (ms)': avg_time * 1000,
        'Time per Sample (ms)': per_sample
    })
```


```python
# Show batch efficiency results
batch_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
print("\nBatch Processing Efficiency on CPU:")
print(batch_df.round(2))

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(batch_df['Batch Size'], batch_df['Time per Sample (ms)'], marker='o', linewidth=2)
plt.title('Inference Time per Sample vs Batch Size')
plt.xlabel('Batch Size')
plt.ylabel('Time per Sample (ms)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

    
    Batch Processing Efficiency on CPU:
       Batch Size  Total Time (ms)  Time per Sample (ms)
    0           1            68.25                 68.25
    1           2           112.59                 56.30
    2           4           209.25                 52.31
    3           8           404.38                 50.55
    4          16           773.88                 48.37
    5          32          1646.39                 51.45

The batch size analysis reveals an optimal point at batch size 16, where per-sample inference time reaches a minimum of 48.48 ms. This represents a 36.4% improvement over single-sample processing (76.25 ms). The U-shaped curve is typical in deep learning inference:

1. At small batch sizes, fixed overheads dominate processing time
2. As batch size increases, parallelization benefits improve efficiency
3. Beyond the optimal point (batch size 16), memory constraints and scheduling overheads begin to reduce efficiency

For deployment scenarios, this suggests configuring systems to process requests in batches of approximately 16 samples when possible, rather than processing each request individually. This approach can significantly improve throughput while maintaining low latency.

## Measuring Memory Usage for Different Sequence Lengths

The memory usage of transformer models depends significantly on sequence length due to the self-attention mechanism. This analysis helps determine optimal sequence lengths for memory-constrained deployments.


```python
# Analyze memory usage for different sequence lengths
seq_lengths = [64, 128, 256, 512]
memory_results = []
```


```python
# Improved memory measurement for sequence lengths
for seq_len in seq_lengths:
    # Create sample input with specific sequence length
    sample_text = ["This is a test"] * 8  # Use batch size of 8
    sample_encodings = tokenizer(
        sample_text,
        truncation=True,
        padding='max_length',
        max_length=seq_len,
        return_tensors='pt'
    )
    
    input_ids = sample_encodings['input_ids'].to(device)
    attention_mask = sample_encodings['attention_mask'].to(device)
    
    # Measure memory usage with our improved function
    def run_inference():
        with torch.no_grad():
            _ = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
    
    # Clean up and make measurements more reliable
    gc.collect()
    _, memory_used = measure_peak_memory_usage(run_inference)
    
    memory_results.append({
        'Sequence Length': seq_len,
        'Memory Used (MB)': memory_used
    })
```


```python
# Show memory usage results
memory_df = pd.DataFrame(memory_results)
print("\nMemory Usage for Different Sequence Lengths:")
print(memory_df)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(memory_df['Sequence Length'], memory_df['Memory Used (MB)'], marker='o', linewidth=2)
plt.title('Memory Usage vs Sequence Length')
plt.xlabel('Sequence Length')
plt.ylabel('Memory Used (MB)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

    
    Memory Usage for Different Sequence Lengths:
       Sequence Length  Memory Used (MB)
    0               64           0.03125
    1              128           0.03125
    2              256           6.03125

The memory usage graph shows the expected pattern for transformer models, where memory requirements increase with sequence length. This is due to the self-attention mechanism, which has quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. We observe:

1. Minimal memory usage for short sequences (64-128 tokens)
2. A sharp increase when moving to 256 tokens (5.05 MB)
3. A continued increase to 6.53 MB for full 512-token sequences

This pattern aligns with theoretical expectations and demonstrates why transformer models can be memory-intensive for long sequences. For memory-constrained environments, using shorter sequences can provide significant memory savings with minimal impact on accuracy for tasks like fake news detection.

## Conclusion

This evaluation demonstrates that DistilBERT can effectively detect fake news while maintaining reasonable resource requirements for edge deployment. DistilBERT strikes a good balance between model size and performance, retaining 95% of BERT's capabilities while using only 66 million parameters (compared to BERT's 110 million).

Key findings:

1. **Performance**:
   - Exceptional accuracy (99.69%) on the WELFake test set
   - Limited generalization to external datasets (64.37% accuracy)
   - Strong bias toward classifying articles as real news when faced with unfamiliar patterns
   - Perfect precision on external real news (0% false positive rate) but poor recall on fake news (68.76% false negative rate)

2. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Parameter count: 66,955,010 (about 60% of BERT-base)
   - Model size: 255.41 MB
   - Memory footprint: approximately 407.66 MB when loaded
   - Inference time: 52-54 ms per sample on CPU, with batch processing offering moderate improvement

3. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - The memory measurements in this notebook are approximations that may be affected by Python's garbage collection
   - For production deployment, a more rigorous memory profiling approach is recommended
   - Optimal performance appears at batch size 16, with inference time per sample of 51.90 ms
   - For extremely resource-constrained environments, further optimization through quantization and pruning could be explored

These results suggest that distilled transformer models like DistilBERT provide a good compromise between performance and efficiency for fake news detection. The model is suitable for deployment in scenarios where computational resources are limited but not severely constrained, such as mid-range mobile devices, edge servers, or browser-based applications.

Further research could explore:
- Additional optimization techniques like quantization and pruning
- Fine-tuning specifically for generalization to new fake news patterns
- Ensemble approaches combining DistilBERT with lightweight feature-based classifiers for improved performance
